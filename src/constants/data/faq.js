      question: "Will you ghost me after the project is done?",
      answer:
        "Nope. I’m not a dating app match. I’ll be around for updates, bug fixes, and even moral support when your cat walks across your keyboard.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you use templates?",
      answer:
        "Only for angry emails. Your project gets the deluxe, hand-coded, artisan-crafted experience — no copy-paste magic here.",
    },
    {
      question: "What’s your work process?",
      answer:
        "Step 1: You tell me your dreams. Step 2: I turn coffee into code. Step 3: You request 47 changes. Step 4: We laugh, we cry, we launch.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will my project take?",
      answer:
        "Somewhere between 'a good nap' and 'binge-watching an entire Netflix season'. Usually 2–6 weeks depending on complexity and caffeine levels.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I hire you?",
      answer:
        "Because I mix serious skills with unserious vibes. You’ll get clean code, real talk, fast replies, and zero mysterious disappearing acts.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my website work on all devices?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Phones, tablets, fridges, toasters — if it has a screen, your site will shine on it.",
    },
